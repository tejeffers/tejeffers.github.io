I am a computational biologist, focused on investigating how the genome is packaged inside our cells. I recently graduated with my Ph.D. in [Quantitative and Computational Biology] (https://lsi.princeton.edu/qcbgraduate) from Princeton University.

Outside of the lab, I spend my time working with student tutors at the McGraw Center for Teaching and Learning, exploring New York, and collecting insects.
